The solution to this uncommon CSS issue involved several steps:
1. **Verify Image Path and Filename:** Double check the image path and file name for any typos or inconsistencies.  Ensure the image file exists in the specified location.
2. **Inspect for Whitespace:** Look carefully within the CSS rule definition for any extra whitespace, especially around the `url()` function.  Unexpected whitespace can interfere with CSS parsing.
3. **Check for Caching:** Clear your browser's cache or try a different browser to rule out caching problems. Sometimes older browser cached versions can cause this kind of issue.
4. **Inspect for Conflicting CSS:** Check for any other CSS rules that might be overriding or interfering with the `background-image` property.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS applied to the element.  Check for any conflicting `background-color` and `background` properties.

```css
div#myDiv {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-image: url('./images/background.jpg'); /* Corrected Path */
  /* Add any other necessary CSS rules here */
}
```

By carefully addressing these points, the background image should correctly appear.
