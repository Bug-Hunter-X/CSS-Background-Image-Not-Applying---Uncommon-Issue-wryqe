# CSS Background Image Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS where a background image fails to apply despite seemingly correct code.  The problem is not due to obvious errors like typos in the file path or incorrect selectors, making it an uncommon challenge to diagnose.

## Bug Description
A `div` element with a specified ID should display a background image using the `background-image` CSS property.  However, the image does not appear, even though the image file exists and the path appears to be correct.  Potential causes include hidden whitespace, caching problems, or more obscure CSS conflicts.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and `index.html` (not included in repo, you need to create a simple index.html referencing the css file). 
3. Observe that the background image is missing from the `div` element.

## Solution
The solution involves resolving the underlying issues. It's likely to involve checking for subtle errors in the file structure, addressing caching issues, or resolving conflicts with other CSS rules.
